The project consists of using a recurrent neural network LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to predict the price of a company's shares, in this specific case, The Home Depot (HD) company is used. To do this, a data engineering process is applied to obtain the relevant data necessary for model training.
The first step is to collect historical data for The Home Depot stock price, as well as data for the Annual Current Ratio, PE Ratio, Debt Equity Ratio, Turnover, ROE, PS Ratio, CPI (Consumer Price Index) and Interest rates. This data is obtained from trusted sources, such as financial databases or online data services.
Once the LSTM model is trained, the prediction of the future stock price is performed. Historical data and related characteristics such as the Annual Current Ratio, PE Ratio, Debt Equity Ratio, Turnover, ROE, PS Ratio, CPI, and interest rates are used to predict The Home Depot's stock price in a future period.
Finally, the performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as the mean square error (MSE) or the coefficient of determination (R2).
